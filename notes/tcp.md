# TCP Protocol

## Flags

* URG — Process the current TCP packet immediately. Directs the receiving system to examine the “urgent pointer” field.
* ACK — Acknowledgement. Directs the receiving system to examine the “acknowledgement number” field.
* PSH — Push. Elevate the priority of the packet’s data, but does not otherwise change rules around packet processing.
* RST — Reset. Terminates the connection forcefully.
* SYN — Synchronize. Used during the initial three-way handshake to set a shared (starting) sequence number.
* FIN — Finish. Indicates that the connection may be dropped gracefully.

## Acknowledgement Number

The TCP “acknowledgment number” contains the *next* sequence number that the sender is expecting to receive (so basically senders determine the next sequence number). This is 0 in the case of RST packets.
