# Using NFS

## NFS Basics

All versions of [NFS use port 2049](https://racinpaper.com/auto-racing/what-is-nfs-port-number-in-linux.html) to transfer data; NFSv1 - NFSv3 also depended on the ‚Äúportmapper‚Äù service running on port 111, but this requirement was removed in NFSv4.

```bash
# List NFS shares.
#
showmount -e $SERVER_IP

# Mount an NFS share.
#
sudo mount -t nfs ${SERVER_IP}:${SHARE_PATH} $LOCAL_MOUNT_DIR -nolock

# Force-unmount an unresponsive share.
#
sudo umount -f $LOCAL_MOUNT_DIR
```

Note that the mount directory must be owned by root.

## Root Squashing

Files created on NFS shares inherit the *remote* UID. By default, NFS enables ‚Äúroot squashing‚Äù, which maps UID 0 to the `nobody` user.

Root squashing can be *disabled* in /etc/exports with the `no_root_squash` flag. This is obviously insecure, however, as it allows a user that connects to that share as root to drop SUID binaries!
