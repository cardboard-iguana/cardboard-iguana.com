# System Information

```bash
oslevel     # Report system version
oslevel -rq # Report "technology level" (major release?)
            # information
oslevel -sq # Report service pack information
```

Different system components ("filesets") can be at different technology levels / service packs. You can list which software that is more (`-g`) or less (`-l`) recent than a given technology level (`-r`) or service pack (`-s`); for example:

```bash
oslevel -s -l $SERVICE_PACK # List filesets below the specified
                            # service pack
```

# Fileset Information

```bash
lslpp -l               # List all filesets
lslpp -h $FILESET_NAME # Detailed fileset information
```

Some versions of AIX can also apparently use the RPM package manager.
