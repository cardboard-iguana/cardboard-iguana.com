# Using Hydra

Hydra can actually brute-force remote services, though I have some skepticism about how useful this is in practice.

```bash
hydra -t 4 -l $USER_NAME -P $WORDLIST \
      -f $TARGET_IP_ADDRESS $SERVICE
```

Here `$SERVICE` is ‚Äússh‚Äù, ‚Äúftp‚Äù, etc. Note that "http" is not used directly; instead use "http-get", "http-put", etc.

### Options

* `-f` ‚Äî Stop after the first successful match. Useful if you are just trying to brute-force a single username!
* `-l` ‚Äî Specify the username whose password you want to brute force.
* `-L` ‚Äî Specify a file listing of usernames (one per line) you want to brute force.
* `-p` ‚Äî Specify the password you want to attempt. Most useful in conjunction with `-L`.
* `-P` ‚Äî Specify a file listing of passwords (one per line) you want to brute force.
* `-s` ‚Äî Use a non-default port for `$SERVICE`.
* `-t` ‚Äî Specifies the number of threads (parallel connection attempts) that Hydra should make at any one time.
* `-V` ‚Äî Verbose output. Use `-vV` for even more verbose output, or `-d` for debugging output.

## Attacking API Endpoints Using JSON

Hydra can be used to attack API endpoints that accept JSON (though apparently there can be some problems with the headers that are passed along):

```bash
hydra -vV -f -l $USERNAME -P $PASSWORDLIST \
	$HOST http-post-form \
	$ENDPOINT:"$TEMPLATE":F="$INVALID":H="Content-Type\: application/json"
```

The `$TEMPLATE` is basically the JSON request body with the special placeholders `^USER^` and `^PASS^` (colons escaped). `$INVALID` is a string that will appear for login *failures* (note that this string *cannot* contain a colon, but fortunately is a substring match). The `H` parameter at the end allows us to override specific headers (necessary because otherwise Hydra sends a Content-Type of application/x-www-form-urlencoded).
