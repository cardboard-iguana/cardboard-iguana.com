# Using Mimikatz

Mimikatz needs to be run with administrative privileges (on the local machine), and provides its own command prompt. Use the `privilege::debug` command to check if you‚Äôre running with the right privileges.

## Dumping Tickets

Mimikatz can dump ticket granting tickets (and session keys) from the memory of Windows‚Äô Local Security Authority Subsystem Service (LSASS); these can then be used to for privilege elevation or lateral movement (depending on which users are active on that machine).

Use the `sekurlsa::tickets /export` command to dump any Kerberos ‚Äùtickets‚Äù (really ticket + session key data structures) from LSASS‚Äôs memory as [.kirbi files](kerberos.md). Tickets are named like ID-USER-SERVICE-DOMAIN.kirbi; ticket granting tickets have a `krbtgt` SERVICE name. If you can find a `krbtgt` ticket belonging to an administrator account, then you‚Äôve (almost) struck gold.

## Pass the Ticket Attacks

Use the `kerberos::ptt TICKET_FILE` command to load the data structure in the specified [.kirbi file](kerberos.md) into memory (allowing the account you‚Äôre logged in as to ‚Äúpass the ticket‚Äù and impersonate the user whose ticket you‚Äôve harvested).

## Golden/Silver Ticket Attacks

To generate a gold or silver ticket using Mimikatz, begin by running the `lsadump::lsa /inject /name:SERVICE` command to retrieve the service SID and NTLM password hash for that service. If SERVICE is `krbtgt` then this will allow the creation of a golden ticket, otherwise you‚Äôll be creating a silver ticket.

(You can also use a user name instead of SERVICE, in which case it appears that Mimikatz will just request a ticket granting ticket from the KDC as that user in the next step; this is theoretically just as noisy as a golden ticket, but looks more ‚Äúnormal‚Äù.)

To actually create and cache the ticket, use `Kerberos::golden /user:USER /domain:DOMAIN /sid:SID /krbtgt:HASH /id:TYPE`, where:

* `USER` is the user to create the ticket for (probably the one you‚Äôve compromised).
* `DOMAIN` is the domain to create the ticket for.
* `SID` is the SID of the service from the previous step.
* `HASH` is the [NT hash](windows-password-hashes.md) of the service password from the previous step.
* `TYPE` is the type of Kerberos ticket to create; use 500 for a golden (ticket granting) ticket, and 1103 for a service ticket.

Once the ticket has been created, use `misc::cmd` to open a command prompt using the newly forged ticket.

## KDC Skeleton Key

If Mimikatz is run on a domain controller, it can modify the authentication service‚Äôs memory using the `misc::skeleton` command to cause it to attempt to decrypt the AS-REQ using *both* the user‚Äôs [NT hash](windows-password-hashes.md) *and* an [NT hash](windows-password-hashes.md) of your choosing (by default `60BA4FCADC466C7A033C178194C03DF6`, which is just `mimikatz`).  This means that you can send an AS-REQ as any user using the ‚Äúskeleton key‚Äù hash to gain access as that user, similar to a golden ticket attack.

Obviously this isn‚Äôt very persistent itself, as the skeleton key will be lost if the server is rebooted or the authentication service restarted.
