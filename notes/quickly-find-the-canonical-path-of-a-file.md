# Quickly Find the Canonical Path of a File

**author**:: Nathan Acks

On Debian-based systems and derivatives, use `readlink`.

Some useful options from the man page:

> -f, --canonicalize
> canonicalize by following every symlink in every component of the given name recursively; all but the last component must exist
> 
> -e, --canonicalize-existing
> canonicalize by following every symlink in every component of the given name recursively, all components must exist
> 
> -m, --canonicalize-missing
> canonicalize by following every symlink in every component of the given name recursively, without requirements on components existence

Note that this follows symlinks, so it's not suitable for every use.
