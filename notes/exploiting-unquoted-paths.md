# Exploiting Unquoted Paths

When Windows encounters an unquoted path it tries *all* possible paths, from shortest to longest. Thus `C:\Program Files\Application Path\app.exe` will cause Windows to look for the following executables, in order:

* `C:\Program.exe`
* `C:\Program Files\Application.exe`
* `C:\Program Files\Application Path\app.exe`

If an executable is found on a shorter path, then the remainder of the (unquoted) path is treated as command line parameters.
