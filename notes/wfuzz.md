# Using ‚Äúwfuzz‚Äù

wfuzz is a URL fuzzer -- basically the command-line version of the [Burp Suite Intruder](burp-suite.md) (but it's *much* faster, which is what one would generally expect from a command-line tool).

| Flag | Meaning                                                    |
|:----:|:---------------------------------------------------------- |
| `-c` | Use color                                                  |
| `-z` | Specify the wordlist that will replace FUZZ in the request |

Basically, the word "FUZZ" in the URL will be replaced by elements of the wordlist specified by `-z`. Multiple slots can be specified using "FUZ2Z", "FUZ3Z", etc.

```bash
wfuzz -z file,rockyou.txt https://example.com/FUZZ/img/secret.webp
```

Use `wfuzz --help` for a full list of options. The `--hc 404` option is particularly useful for hiding pages that return a 404.
