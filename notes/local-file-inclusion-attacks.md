# LFI (Local File Inclusion) Attacks

LFI vulnerabilities are *most* common in PHP, but are sometimes found in other languages/frameworks.

Since web servers are typically serving content from `/var/www`, `/var/www/srv`, or an immediate subdirectory for virtual hosts, you generally need to use `../../`, `../../../`, or `../../../../` to reach `/`.

## PHP Tricks

For PHP < 5.3.4, you can use the poison null byte to defeat simple path filters or situations where the developer is appending some suffix to user input.

If the poison null byte doesnâ€™t work, another trick relies on the fact that for some bizarre reason PHP allows files to be referenced with `.` notation just like directories. In other words, `/etc/passwd/.` will return the contents of `/etc/passwd`!

Representing `../` as `....//` can bypass filters that replace `../`, as PHP search-and-replace only does a single pass through a string (it should be obvious how to extend this if a developer tries  to just run a search and replace *twice*).
