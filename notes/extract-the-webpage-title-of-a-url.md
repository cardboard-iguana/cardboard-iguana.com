# Extract the Webpage Title of a URL

```bash
python3 -c "import bs4, requests; print(bs4.BeautifulSoup(requests.get('$URL').text).title.text)"
```

This needs the python3-bs4 package on Debian-based distribution. Note that we use the .text method  instead of .content to ensure that we get back a unicode string (rather than just the raw bytes, which can and will get mangled by anything you pipe this into).

NOTE: This wonâ€™t work on webpages for sites like Twitter that set the `<title/>` using JavaScript after initial page load.
