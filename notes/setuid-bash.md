# SETUID Bash

Letâ€™s say you manage to get a copy of bash on a system thatâ€™s (1) owned by root and (2) has the SUID bit set. If you just try to execute it, bash will still drop privileges, and youâ€™ll be running as the same user you were before!

To prevent this, run bash with the -p flag (`./bash -p`), which helpfully instructs bash to *not* drop privs.
