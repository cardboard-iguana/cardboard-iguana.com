# Get-WinEvent

Get-WinEvent is a [PowerShell](powershell.md) command for working with [Windows event logs](windows-event-logs.md).

```powershell
# Get help on Get-WinEvent (calls out to Microsoft).
#
Get-Help Get-WinEvent

# Filter event log output using the Where-Object command.
# This apparently pipes the entire output to the
# Where-Object command, which then scans for the appropriate
# field. So a bit inefficient for large logs.
#
Get-WinEvent -LogName Application | Where-Object { $_.ProviderName -Match 'WLMS' }

# To match event IDs with Where-Object, use the slightly
# different form `Where-Object Id -eq  100`, etc.

# Use the -FilterHashtable flag. This causes the filtering
# to be done during the call made by Get-WinEvent, and has a
# more straight-forward syntax too. However, it only works
# when called against the system event log; Where-Object
# needs to be used when specifying an archived log via
# -Path.
#
# Note that hashes can be specified with newlines instead of
# semicolons as well, which can make scripts A LOT more
# readable!
#
Get-WinEvent -FilterHashtable @{ LogName = 'Application'; ProviderName = 'WLMS' }

# To display all information about an event, pipe the output
# of Get-WinEvent to `Format-List -Property *`
```
