# Useful HTTP Headers

| Header          | Purpose / Notes                                                                                                     |
|:--------------- |:------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Server          | Web server information (Apache, NGINX, etc.); useful for recon.                                                     |
| True-Client-IP  | Override the client IP address (direct connections to servers).                                                     |
| X-Forwarded-For | Override the client IP address (connections forwarded through proxies).                                             |
| X-Powered-By    | Added by some application engines to advertise themselves; useful for recon.                                        |
| Content-Type    | Probably needs to be manipulated for POST requests â€” for example, form data uses application/x-www-form-urlencoded. |
| Content-Length  | The length of the body in bytes (which is just characters for ASCII) for POST requests.                             |
