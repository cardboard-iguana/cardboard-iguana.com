# Exploiting /etc/passwd

author:: Nathan Acks  
date:: 2022-08-19

*If* `/etc/passwd` has weak permissions, then passwords in it can be replaced (since Linux systems still use the password hashes in `/etc/passwd` preferentially to those in `/etc/shadow`). This means that we can just directly add root-equivalent users directly there (remember that the UID and primary GID can be duplicated!).

To generate a password acceptable for inclusion in `/etc/passwd`:

```bash
openssl passwd -1 -salt $SALT $PASSWORD
```
