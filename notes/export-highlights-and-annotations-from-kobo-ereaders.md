# Export Highlights and Annotations from Kobo eReaders

author:: Nathan Acks

Open up D:/.kobo/Kobo/Kobo eReader.conf (where D: is the Kobo's mount point) and add (or modify) the following block:

```ini
[FeatureSettings]
ExportHighlights=true
```

This should add a new menu option for a given book (accessible in My Books) allowing highlights and annotations to be extracted to the root of the Kobo mount.
