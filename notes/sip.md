SIP usually uses ports 5060 TCP or UDP for unencrypted signaling or 5061 for encrypted transportation using TLS.

SIP is an ASCII based protocol which has some similar elements like in the HTTP protocol by using a request/response model. Much like an HTTP request from a browser a SIP client request is made using a SIP URI a user agent and a method/request. SIP uses e-mail like addresses format:

* sip:205@192.168.1.100
* sip:username@pbx.com
* sip:205@192.168.1.100:5060
* etc.

# SIP Requests/Methods

* INVITE - Used to invite and account to participate in a call session.
* ACK - Acknowledge an INVITE request.
* CANCEL - Cancel a pending request.
* REGISTER - Register user with a SIP server.
* OPTIONS - Lists information about the capabilities of a caller.
* BYE - Terminates a session between two users in a call.
* REFER - Indicates that the recipient(identified by the Request URI) should contact a third party using the contact information provided in the request.
* SUBSCRIBE - The SUBSCRIBE method is used to request current state and state updates from a remote node.
* NOTIFY - The NOTIFY method is used to notify a SIP node that an event which has been requested by an earlier SUBSCRIBE method has occurred.
