# Force “more” Into Interactive Mode

The `more` command acts like cat whenever it can. The only way to force `more` into interactive mode is to make your terminal smaller than the number of lines in the file being displayed.

Incidentally, this means that it’s impossible to send commands to when using it to display a one-line file.
