## CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram

### Weak Configurations

My favorite quip is here! ‚ÄúUnnecessary complexity‚Äù as a security vulnerability!

Elements of weak configurations:

* Errors
* Open permissions
* Unsecured root/system accounts
* Weak encryption
* Insecure protocols
* Default settings (IMHO, depends on the defaults)
* (Improperly) Open (or unneeded) ports/services

Another gem that parallels something I like to repeat:

> ‚ÄúAn organization should never try to create its own cryptographic algorithms within systems.‚Äù
> 
> ‚Äî CompTIA Security+ SY0-601 Exam Cram, 6/e

The Exam Cram implies that leaving all services enabled will seldom be the correct answer when presented with a device configuration scenario on the Security+ exam.

### Improper of Weak Patch Management

Types of updates:

* Hotfix: A targeted update that alters the target application or operating system in a limited way. Generally small and out-of-band.
* Service Pack: A bundle all hotfixes and updates (security or not) up to a certain point. Mostly a Windows thing.
* Update: A non-critical, non-security bugfix.

Microsoft divides updates into ‚Äúsecurity updates‚Äù (which address security issues), ‚Äúcritical updates‚Äù (non-security updates that fix high-impact bugs), and just plain ‚Äúupdates‚Äù (everything else).

### Third-Party Risks

Exam Cram indicates that the Security+ exam will likely ask about the dangers of end-of-life systems.

### Impacts

Type of potential incident impacts:

* Data loss (deletion, in this case)
* Data breach
* Identity theft
* Financial losses
* Reputational losses
* Downtime
* Physical danger and loss of life

### Vulnerabilities

Vulnerability: Any weakness that creates an avenue for attack.

Some specifics that the Security+ exam targets:

* Weak configurations (default, weak or non-exsistent encryption, insecure protocols, wide permissions)
* Cloud vs. on-prem
* Third-party risks

There are lots of third-party risks. Everything that might go wrong in-house can also go wrong with a vendor.

Many times the reason organizations will attempt to refactor third-party applications or drivers (see yesterday‚Äôs notes) is because of lack of current vendor support (and occasionally lack of vendor entirely).
