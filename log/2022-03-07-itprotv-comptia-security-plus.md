# ITPro.TV: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) #Draft

Because the next block of units on ITPro.TV cover three chapters in the Exam Cram (at least as best I can map them without having first read the chapters), I’m going to try something a bit different: For the next three days I’m only going to be doing the readings, and then I’ll set Exam Cram aside to work on the lectures.

I’m going to continue to title these posts after ITPro.TV though, since I’m thinking of the Exam Cram as just an adjunct to that.

## CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram

Today I’ll be covering chapter 12 of the Exam Cram, “Authentication and Authorization Design”.
