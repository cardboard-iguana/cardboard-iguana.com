## Metasploit

### Rock ‘em To the Core

The `spool` command can be used to save all Metasploit console output to a log file, which can be useful for record-keeping.

### Modules for Every Occasion!

Core Metasploit modules:

* EXPLOIT code;
* Post-exploitation PAYLOADs;
* AUXILIARY functions, such as scanning machines for vulnerabilities;
* POST exploitation tools for “looting” and pivoting;
* An ENCODER module for obfuscating exploits;
* And finally a module called NOP that includes tools for exploiting buffer overflows and [return-orientated programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Return-oriented_programming).

Note that Metasploit 6 apparently calls these “framework plugins” now.
