# TryHackMe: Complete Beginner (Supplements)

## MAL: Researching

### Online Sandboxing

Online automated malware analysis sandboxes:

*   [any.run](https://any.run/)
*   [hybrid-analysis](https://hybrid-analysis.com/)

### Practical: Calculating & Reporting Checksums

Calculating file hashes with PowerShell!

```powershell
# Using CertUtil
#
CertUtil -hashfile $FILE_PATH $ALGORITHM

# Using Get-FileHash
#
Get-FileHash -Algorithm $ALGORITHM $FILE_PATH
```

In both cases, the algorithm can be excluded (in which case SHA1 is used for CertUtil and SHA-256 is used for Get-FileHash). *Lots* of different hashing algorithms are supported â€” run `help Get-FileHash`, etc. to see a list.

## MAL: Strings

### Practical: Finding Bitcoin Addresses in Ransomware

Blockchain exploration tool (search for hashes):

* [BlockCypher](https://live.blockcypher.com/)

(Not a lot of supported blockchains thoughâ€¦)

Fun side-note: PowerShell can use Linux-style redirects (`>`)!

## Google Dorking

### Enter: Search Engine Optimization

It looks like all of Googleâ€™s optimization tests live at [web.dev](https://web.dev/measure/) now.

### BeepBoop â€” Robots.txt

I always forget that the `Sitemap` directive lives in `robots.txt`.

It turns out that most web crawlers support regexes in the `Allow`/`Disallow` statements. Also, directives for different crawlers can be given by using multiple `User-agent` directives (apparently a crawler will only use the first block that it matches up until a new `User-agent` directive).

### What is Google Dorking?

Useful Google search modifiers:

| Directive   | Effect                                                  |
|:----------- |:------------------------------------------------------- |
| `site:`     | Limit results to the provided domain                    |
| `filetype:` | Limit results to the provided file type (PDF, etc.)     |
| `intitle:`  | Require that the page title contain particular keywords |
| `cache:`    | View the most recent cached version of a particular URL |

## Wireshark 101

### Collection Methods

Ways to gather packets:

* Just listen to the packets that you can see normally (really only works on very simple/insecure networks).
* Physical taps ([Packet Squirrel](https://hak5.org/products/packet-squirrel), [LAN Turtle](https://hak5.org/products/lan-turtle), etc.)
* MAC flooding (fill up a switchâ€™s CAM table with bogus requests until it is forced to fall back to acting like a dum hub; somewhat dangerous).
* ARP poisoning (falsely advertise yourself as the router or another machine; less dangerous than MAC flooding but harder to successfully pull off).
