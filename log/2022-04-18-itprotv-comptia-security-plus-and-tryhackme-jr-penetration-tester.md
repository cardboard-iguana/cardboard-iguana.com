## CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram

Today‚Äôs reading is Chapter 28 from the Security+ Exam Cram, ‚ÄúIncident Investigation‚Äù.

### SIEM Dashboards

The key to SIEM alerting is the correlation engine ‚Äî looking for user connections *after* that user has left the office, etc.

### Logging

Log files = documentation (of system/application/user activity)

> Web server logs are usually access logs, common error logs, custom logs, and W3C logs. W3C logs are used mainly by web servers to log web-related events, including web logs.

Huh?

(It looks like W3C logs are just a particular standardized log format. Despite coming out of the W3C, only IIS and Amazon Cloudfront seem to use this.)

Windows Event Log fields:

| Field         | Data                                                                    |
|:------------- |:----------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Type          | Warning, error, information, etc.                                       |
| Time          | Date/time for the computer *sending* the log                            |
| Computer      | Computer name                                                           |
| Provider Type | The facility that generated the event (generally the Windows Event Log) |
| Provider Name | The name of the log (Application, Security, etc.)                       |
| Source        | Application                                                             |
| Event ID      | Standardized (*not* unique!) identifier                                 |
| Description   | Self-explanatory                                                        |

Event IDs from the Windows Event Log can generally be looked up in the Microsoft Knowledge base.

One way to think about SNMP is as a data source for multi-system logs.

A Windows-centric list of log types:

* System
* Audit (events important for auditing and forensics needs; user logins go here)
* Security
* Access (system-to-system ‚Äî not user! ‚Äî access events)

Anomaly detection generally works better on network logs than device logs.

Heh‚Ä¶ `journald` *still* doesn‚Äôt have remote logging, instead relying on forwarding to a syslog-compatible daemon.

### Network Activity

Most network activity monitoring tools don‚Äôt store actual packets, but rather just log metadata about those packets (minimally: source, destination, protocol).

### Protocol Analyzers

Protocol Analyzer = Packet Sniffer

Now we‚Äôre talking about actual packet capture!

### Network Flow

A.k.a. ‚ÄúNetFlow‚Äù (originally a Cisco thing, but since genericized). Basically, this is packet capture and analysis on router interfaces. NetFlow (and related tools like sFlow) are oriented towards understanding network usage rather than the behavior of individual machines/connections.

NetFlow data is exported using the IPFIX (Internet Protocol Flow Information Export) format.

### Investigational Data Sources

SIEM = You 10,000 ft view

The SIEM correlation engine is just a (user defined?) list of event sequences of interest.

IPFIX is an IETF standard.

Wireshark has some statistical packet-analysis capabilities.

General log analysis flow: Filtered down to warnings/errors, locate an event of interest, and then expand your search around that timeframe to include lower-level/priority events.

Call out to WinDbg Preview, which is a free Windows dump file analyzer in the Microsoft Store. Windows typically stores dump files in `C:\Windows`, so you‚Äôll need to copy it out to view it.
