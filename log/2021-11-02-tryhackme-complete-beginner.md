## Linux PrivEsc

### Cron Jobs

Remember the `locate` tool! It's faster than `find` (assuming that it's installed, and the database is up-to-date, and the file you're looking for is accessible to `nobody`...).

Also, the Bash reverse shell makes an appearance here!

Remember that SUID Bash will drop privileges by default; execute with the `-p` option to avoid this.

Okay, this is wild... It looks like the wildcard expansion (`*`) in Bash scripts doesn't get pushed to the command, but is instead expanded in place. This means that files named like command-line switches *will be interpreted as command line switches*. This can be used, for example, to exploit sloppy tar-based backup scripts.

### SUID / SGID Executables

Quick-n-dirty command to find all SUID/SGID executables.

```bash
find / -type f \
       -a \( -perm -u+s -o -perm -g+s \) \
       -exec ls -l {} \; 2> /dev/null
```

Quickly see what shared libraries an executable is trying to load:

```bash
strace $EXECUTABLE 2>&1 | grep open
```

If there are missing libraries in paths that we're able to access, then code similar to the LD_PRELOAD trick can be used to inject malicious code

Running `strings` on a binary can also give us a sense of what helper applications might be getting executed.

### NFS

Files created on NFS shares inherit the *remote* UID. By default, NFS enables "root squashing", which maps UID 0 to the `nobody` user.

Root squashing can be *disabled* in /etc/exports with the `no_root_squash` flag. 

Unrelatedly, msfvenom can be used to generate executables that immediately shell out, similar to the LD_PRELOAD trick.

### Privilege Escalation Scripts

* [LinEnum](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration)
* [Linux Smart Enumeration (LSE)](https://github.com/diego-treitos/linux-smart-enumeration)
* [LinPEAS](https://github.com/carlospolop/PEASS-ng/tree/master/linPEAS)

LinEnum is very fast, but LSE and LinPEAS produce more intelligible output.
