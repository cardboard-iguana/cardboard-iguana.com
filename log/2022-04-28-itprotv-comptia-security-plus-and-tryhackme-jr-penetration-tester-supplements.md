## ITPro.TV: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601)

### Organizational Security Policies — Data

Data classification involves the data owner labeling the data in question so that only appropriate people have access to it (with the appropriate privileges).

There’s also data *categorization*, which is a different but related concept that labels the data in question based on the business impact should it become unavailable.

“Governance” is the “system by which an organization directs and controls IT security” (per ISO 38500). Governance is about *who* can make decisions, while *management* is about making decisions to mitigate risk.

Governance is strategic, but management is operational.

Policies (and sometimes procedures) are generally about governance — we’re doing X, and person Y is in charge. The management then becomes the question of *how* person Y implements X.

### Organizational Security Policies — Other Areas

“Change management” is the *process* of implementing and documenting changes, while “change control” encompasses the actual technical controls used to realize this. “Change management” is “all roll-outs must have a roll-back plan”, while the use of git would be a “change control”. The universe of “change controls” is thus a proper subset of the universe of “change management”.
