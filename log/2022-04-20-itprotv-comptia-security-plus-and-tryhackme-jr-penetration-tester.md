## ITPro.TV: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601)

### Incident Response Process

Event = Something that raises a potential security flag.

Incident = A violation of some security process or policy.

Phases:

* Preparation (logging and monitoring)
* Identification (detection, analysis, and alerting of *events*)
* Containment (network isolation, system shutdowns, etc.)
* Eradication (malware removal, wipe-and-reload, etc. *and* verify that no additional systems are impacted)
* Recovery (return to normal‚Ä¶ *after* verification of eradication)
* Lessons Learned

Part of recovery is ascertaining *how* the incident occurred and remediating the associated vulnerability/vulnerabilities.

A good distinction: A ‚Äúrunbook‚Äù is an *automated* playbook.

Things to have in your after action report:

* What went right?
* What went‚Ä¶ well?
* What went wrong?
* What was impacted?
* How was the attack accomplished?
* How can existing systems be improved?

### Incident Response Plans

* Who are you reporting to? Who approves your actions? Who initiates the incidence response process?
* Who‚Äôs on your team? (IT, experts, consultants, LEOs, etc.)
* Who are your stakeholders? What are your responsibilities to them? How will they be communicated with?
* How are internal comms handled? External comms? (And when?)
* How is evidence handled, documented, and retained?

BCDRP = Business Continuity and Disaster Recovery Plan

Exercises, in order of how closely they mimic/interrogate the IRP:

* Tabletop exercises
* Walkthroughs
* Simulations

There‚Äôs actually a tabletop game created by Black Hills Information Security that‚Äôs designed to help with tabletop exercises.

### Attack Frameworks

An ‚Äúattack framework‚Äù is just a way to describe an attack in a standardized fashion.

* MITRE ATT&CK (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques & Common Knowledge)
* Diamond Model (from top clockwise: adversary, capabilities, victim, infrastructure)
* Cyber Kill Chain (recon, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, actions on objective)

The diamond model can be summarized as, ‚Äúfor every intrusion, there exists an *adversary* who is using their *capabilities* over/with some kind of infrastructure *infrastructure* to attack a *victim*.‚Äù

MITRE ATT&CK is really the gold standard though.
