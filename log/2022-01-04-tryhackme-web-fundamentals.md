## Burp Suite: The Basics

### Introduction

I've done quite a few rooms involving Burp Suite before, but this definitely looks like the most comprehensive sequence I've yet done. Maybe there'll be something similar for [Metasploit](../notes/metasploit.md) later...

### What is Burp Suite

This section mentions using Burp Suite for mobile application testing. I'm guessing this is either in reference to directly testing server APIs, or to setting up a middlebox that directs HTTP traffic through the Burp Suite proxy so that it can be manipulated on-the-wire.
