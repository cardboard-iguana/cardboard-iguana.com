While I don’t think I’m quite ready yet to take a crack at the OSCP, Offensive Security’s free streaming classes (“OffSec Live”) seem like too good of a deal to pass up. I wasn’t able to catch the first because I was traveling, but I’ll be watching (and taking notes on) as many other sections as I can moving forward.
