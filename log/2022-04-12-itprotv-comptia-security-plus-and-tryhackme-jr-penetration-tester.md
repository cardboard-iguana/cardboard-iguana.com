# ITPro.TV: CompTIA Security+ (SY0-601) & TryHackMe: Jr. Penetration Tester #Draft

## CompTIA Security+ Exam Cram

Today‚Äôs reading is Chapter 30 from the Security+ Exam Cram, ‚ÄúDigital Forensics‚Äù.

### Order of Volatility

The idea here is to gather evidence from the most volatile storage (generally RAM) to the least volatile (generally backups or off-system logs). Prioritize imaging/copying/investigating storage so that you run the minimum risk of loosing information!

First-line information:

* System date, time, etc.
* Currently established network connections
* Currently open ports and associated applications/services
* Other running applications/services

Typical order of volatility:

* CPU registers/caches
* Peripheral & expansion card memory (particularly networking cards)
* Kernel memory
* Non-kernel memory
* tmpfs & friends
* Onboard storage
* Removable rewritable storage
* Removable write-once storage

I‚Äôm guessing that external logs probably sit between removable rewritable storage and removable write-once storage.

### Chain of Custody

Basically, log all the things. Time, date, action, people involved. Include thought processes and inferences. Properties:

* Admissible (following legal or organizational standards)
* Authentic (shown to be related to the investigation at hand)
* Complete (covers all angles ‚Äî for example, *all* users logged into a system, not just accounts of interest)
* Reliable (shown to be unmodified)
* Believable (basically, written in a way that non-technical audiences can follow)

Investigative steps:

* Identify potential evidence
* Determine preservation techniques
* Extract, process, log, interpret, etc.
* Clean up for presentation (corporate or legal)

### Data Acquisition

* System Images (be careful to ensure that these cannot be inadvertently written to during analysis!)
* Network Traffic & Logs (traffic is generally only captured in the event that the incident is ongoing when the investigation begins)
* Video & Photographs (the point here is to try to demonstrate that evidence was not planted)
* System Time & Time Zone (important to record early because computers use all sorts of different time zones)
* Hashes (to verify that forensic images are the same as the original data, and that data has not been changed during analysis)
* Screenshots
* Witnesses
