# Minify: https://github.com/tdewolff/minify

# Current version: 2.9.22 (last checked 2021-11-14)
#
# It's too bad we need to cart this binary around as part of the repo,
# but Fleek doesn't support installing our own tools (otherwise we'd
# just `apt install minify`).
#
# Note that sometimes `minify` will fail on a file, but when it does it
# simply leaves it untouched. We therefore return "true" at the end of
# the process in order to prevent Fleek from seeing this as a bad build.
#
# WARNING! Running `minify` AND Fleek's built-in optimization tends to
# result in invalid HTML/CSS/JS output! Fleek's optimization should
# therefore be turned off when "hand optimization" like this is used.
